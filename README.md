# Awesome IRB Theme

This repository contains the sources for the **awesome-irb-theme** website. The site showcases color themes for Ruby's interactive console (IRB) with preview images and links to each theme.

The site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the "minima" theme. Each IRB theme is represented as a blog post under the `_posts` directory and includes a screenshot preview.

## Running Locally

To build or preview the site on your machine, first install dependencies and then run Jekyll:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

For additional details about project setup, see [docs/DETAILS.md](docs/DETAILS.md).
